# Proof of Concept
The goal is to replicate the sankey chart of Alphabet Inc FY 2022 Income Statement with Plotly to produce a prototype visualization.


## Methology
### Income Statement
We would go to <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch">SEC Edgar</a> to search for the Alphabet's 2022 10-K to obtain the income statement and the supplemental data. We will produce a sankey chart like this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/10ur1ya/oc_how_google_makes_money_its_2022_income/">post</a> using Plotly and Python, while the data will be hardcoded in the script.

### Balance Sheet
Coming soon...

### Cashflow Statement
